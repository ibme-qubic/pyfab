PYFAB - Python interface to the Fabber Bayesian modelling tool
==============================================================

PYFAB provides a Python interface to the Fabber model fitting tool, which
was developed primarily for modelling of fMRI data such as ASL, CEST and DSC
MRI sequences.

included with FSL v6.0.1 and later, including model libraries for ASL,
CEST, DSC, dualecho and DCE data.
