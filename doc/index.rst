PYFAB - Python interface to the Fabber Bayesian modelling tool
==============================================================

PYFAB provides a Python interface to the 
`Fabber model fitting tool <https://fabber_core.readthedocs.io>`_, which
was developed primarily for modelling of fMRI data such as ASL, CEST and DSC
MRI sequences.

To use PYFAB, the Fabber command or library must be installed. Fabber is 
included with 
`FSL <https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/>`_ v6.0.1 and later, including model libraries for ASL,
CEST, DSC, dualecho and DCE data.
